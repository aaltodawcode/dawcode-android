### Disclaimer

This repository contains the research application from a research project on 
distance-aware barcodes. The application is not built for production purposes
and is merely a by-product of evaluating several strategies of constructing 
distance-aware barcodes based on color blending. As such, it is not optimized
for performance and contains duplicate code.

This application was tested with OnePlus 6 smartphones. Minor adjustments might be necessary to make it work with other devices.

### Features

Implements distance-aware barcodes with 1-bit color-blending modules.
