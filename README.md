# Android application to scan distance-dependent barcodes

This repository contains a sample Android application that is able to scan the distance-aware barcodes introduced in the following research article:

([Publisher's page](https://doi.org/10.1145/3379503.3403534))

See also the [related website](https://dawcode.aalto.fi/) for additional information.

The software relies on the following libraries:

- [a version of OpenCV for Android with extended support for OpenCL](https://github.com/aaltodawcode/opencv-sdk-4.0.0);

- the C++ version of [EZPWD Reed-Solomon](https://github.com/pjkundert/ezpwd-reed-solomon).

### Disclaimer

This software is distributed on *"as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind*. The application is a sample implementation of the distance-aware barcode scanning algorithm presented in the related research article and is not meant to be used in production. As a consequence, the code is not optimized for performance and has not been refined.

This application was tested with OnePlus 6 smartphones. Minor adjustments might be needed to make it work with other devices.
